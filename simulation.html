        <h2> Space Treaty Crisis Simulation Overview </h2>
       <br>  <h4> <em>Synopsis:</em>
<br> In another planet Earth in a galaxy far, far away, three major nations are preparing to colonize Mars. Using the forum of the United Nations, the United Federation, the Commonwealth Republic, and the Union of Democratic Nations would like to come to an agreement on the issues of mining, water, and colonization on Mars. Each country will send one or two representatives from each of their agencies to negotiate in working groups on the issues of mining, water, and colonization on Mars.

<br> <br> Each student is a representative of an agency for one of the three countries. The agencies include a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Ministry of Military, a Ministry of Trade, and a Space Agency. Use the country profile given to all students, as well as specific agency profiles, to negotiate on behalf of your country. If you have questions, don’t forget that you can talk to other members in your agency/country by phone or computer! You can also ask questions to the simulation assistants as well!

<br> <br> <em> Objectives:</em>
<br> Working groups will try to come to an agreement that represents each country’s interests. Follow your agency and country goals as closely as possible!
